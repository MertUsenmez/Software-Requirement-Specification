A document where the requirements are documented in terms of the system. For example, retrieving a customer's information for an E-commerce site is a functional requirement, and if it is defined in the BRD document, a new page or a pop-up page is required, a system requirement to transfer the database to web services and is defined in the SRS document. In this document, system features (features), interfaces (user / system / hardware interfaces), non-functional system requirements (performance / security / reliability etc.) are defined. Generally, this document is prepared by System Analysts during the analysis period, although system analysts can not be prepared by business analysts with support from the technical team.
